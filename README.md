# ASI Challenge
## Assignment
> Your task is to write a HTTP API that, given a user's GitHub handle, retrieves the top five public repositories owned by that user, ordered by size (the GitHub API has a "size" field that you can use). You should return the data as JSON. Feel free to use the language and tools you are most comfortable in.

> Deploy your API behind a public facing URL so that we can test it. We would be keen to see the code and a brief description of how you deployed the API.
